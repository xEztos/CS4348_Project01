This project simulates a virtual machine, with the CPU being the arithmetic unit processing the commands and handling input output, and the Memory module simulating the machine memory. The CPU process (refered as CPU) is the main file in this project. The CPU process will spawn a sub-process named Memory that will parse a program file and store the commands into the virtual machine memory. The CPU will communicate with Memory, polling the memory with a specified memory address and the Memory will return the data stored at that address. The CPU will then process the instruction, if it is an instruction, or use the data to perform an instruction.
